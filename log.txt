first for px4 sitl

(1) run the sitl
(2) run the global_mapper_ros, in this part I need state <- this topic's message type is 'snapstack_msgs/State'

Header header
time state_stamp
geometry_msgs/Vector3 pos
geometry_msgs/Vector3 vel
geometry_msgs/Quaternion quat
geometry_msgs/Vector3 w
geometry_msgs/Vector3 abias
geometry_msgs/Vector3 gbias

so I need a node to convert the mavros/local_position/ data to state

(3) made launch file in launch folder to run px4 sitl
(4) the snapstack_msgs is for 'https://docs.px4.io/master/en/flight_controller/snapdragon_flight.html'
when I run the simulator the 'w, abias, gbias' values are keeping 0, and now I don't have any ideas about these values, so just set 0 and pass 'pos, vel, quat' from /mavros/local_position/odom
